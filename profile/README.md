## About us ðŸ‘‹

We have been running GTA5/RDR2 role-playing servers ourselves for years and have spent long night shifts tweaking and fixing scripts. 

But at a certain point we wanted more!

- More quality
- More performance
- More design
- More usability
- More resilience
- More responsiveness
- More options
- More configurable stuff
- More fun ;)

So we started to create our own scripts. Primarily for our own servers, of course. 

We were contacted by many other server owners. Now we publish our scripts also for you.
